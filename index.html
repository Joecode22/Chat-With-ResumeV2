  <!-- This project will interface with openAI API to "chat" with the information included in a text file that is my resume -->
  <!-- This page will show a Title section at the top that has my name, a hero section just under it that includes a short paragraph about me, and the main section that has three subsections 1) the animated AI bot avatar that has a ripple effect when she speaks, 2) the answer text output from the LLM as well as the question form input and a submit button, 4) a representation of my resume that you can click to download this is also the source material for the chat -->
